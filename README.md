#Teaching with Twine
 
##About
<!-- Required: Include brief prose description of the project and the repository. This description should build on or contextualize the language in your Twine Object, provide concrete contextual information, or describe the possible applications of your Twine or other materials. 100 words is fine, but you’re free to make this as expansive as you wish to help situate readers in your materials and how they might use them. --> 
Science AL!VE is an organization within the Faculty of Applied Sciences at Simon Fraser University that offers fun, hands-on opportunities for K-12 youth to explore science, technology, engineering, art and design, and mathematics (STEAM) topics. In addition to running youth programs, Science AL!VE supports teachers through providing professional development workshops and teaching resources. The Teaching with Twine workshop is a professional development workshop for high school teachers on how to effectively integrate Twine into K-12 classrooms. This workshop is co-designed by a pre-service teacher educator and a Science AL!VE program coordinator. By attending this workshop, participants learn the basics of Twine through a code-along activity, discuss best practices for using technology in teaching, and gain access to sample lesson plans that feature the integration of Twine. This repository contains resources for the Teaching with Twine workshop for high school teachers.
